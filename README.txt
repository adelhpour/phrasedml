phraSED-ML is a script-like language for defining simulation experiments that is designed to be human-readable and human-writable, but that can be translated to SED-ML for interpretation by simulators.

Inspired by Antimony (which performs the same role for SBML), phraSED-ML is designed to be compact, efficient, and easy to use.

phraSED-ML is supported by NIH/NIGMS Grant # GM081070.
